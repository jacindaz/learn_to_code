# Resources for learning to code
This is a list that I've slowly compiled, and will be continuing to vet.

### To Do's
 * look at money-rails and money gems to figure out how to handle currency
 * how to test and make sure links aren't broken?
 * scraping or API integration to find new resources, without manually adding them

### Resources to add
 * ones from my doc
 * from here: https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/events/236716206/
